# BlockEstate-ETHGlobal
Our BlockEstate decentralized application (DApp) leverages cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize the real estate industry. We have made a rent-to-own protocol in which the buyers can rent the property while also and also redeem ownership while paying the rent of the property. The tenant has the option of buying the property or not, he/she also has the option of selecting the years for which they want to rent the property till they get their ownership. Interest rate will be calculated based on the number of years they select.

The landlord has the option to cancel the agreement( provided tenant's rent is due). The tenant can cancel the agreement anytime. A small percentage of money will be deducted from the tenant if he cancels the agreement and other money will be refunded. 

The owner has the function to list his/her property by filling up the form with the required details.

 Built on the Gnosis chain, an efficient and scalable blockchain platform, our DApp ensures secure and transparent transactions for both renters and homeowners.

Key Features:

1. **EthSign Protocol for Attestation:** We utilize the EthSign protocol to provide robust attestation services, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of crucial documents within the rental and ownership process. This protocol enhances trust and reliability, crucial elements in real estate transactions.

2. **Gnosis Chain Deployment:** Our DApp is deployed on the Gnosis chain, a high-performance blockchain infrastructure known for its scalability, interoperability, and security features. The Gnosis chain provides a robust foundation for our DApp, enabling seamless and efficient transactions while maintaining the integrity of the decentralized ecosystem.

3. **Open Availability on Testnet:** To facilitate testing and development, our DApp is available on the Gnosis chain's testnet environment. This allows developers and users to explore and interact with the platform in a sandbox environment, providing valuable feedback and ensuring a smooth transition to the mainnet.

We started to identify the problems existing in the current market and started to think about the different problems and their solutions . We decided to build a rent-to-own protocol that enables users to list the property, rent property. with the option of buying the property while renting it.

We used foundry to deploy the contracts and wrote our smart contracts on solidity. We built our frontend using react. We used the context api to call all the functions of our smart contract to easily integrate the smart contracts with our react-app. We have created our own subgraph to detch all the data. This project uses @ethsign for attestation and proof generation , @gnosis and @arbitrum for deploying.

Overall, our Blockestate DApp represents the future of real estate transactions, leveraging decentralized technologies to empower renters and homeowners alike. With EthSign for attestation, deployment on the Gnosis chain, availability on testnet, our platform offers a secure, transparent, and efficient solution for transitioning from renting to owning property.
